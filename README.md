# Generative Planning with 3D-vision Language Pre-training for End-to-End Autonomous Driving (GPVL-AAAI2025)
## Overview:
Autonomous driving is a challenging task that requires perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment for safe trajectory planning. While existing vision-based end-to-end models have achieved promising results, these methods are still facing the challenges of vision understanding, decision reasoning and scene generalization. To solve these issues, a generative planning with 3D-vision language pre-training model named GPVL is proposed for end-to-end autonomous driving. The proposed paradigm has two significant aspects. On one hand, a 3D-vision language pre-training module is designed to bridge the gap between visual perception and linguistic understanding in the bird's eye view. On the other hand, a cross-modal language model is introduced to generate holistic driving decisions and fine-grained trajectories with perception and navigation information in an auto-regressive manner. Experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves excellent performances compared with state-of-the-art methods. Besides, the proposed GPVL presents strong generalization ability and real-time potential when handling high-level commands in various scenarios. It is believed that the effective, robust and efficient performance of GPVL is crucial for the practical application of future autonomous driving systems.
## Method:
The overall pipeline of the proposed GPVL model is illustrated in Fig. 1. First, the backbone includes a 3D-vision encoder to obtain the basic BEV feature, then it is decoded into constrained detection, motion and map features. Second, the 3D-vision language pre-training module establishes the associations between vision and language features with the group-wise alignment. Finally, the cross-modal language model generates the future planning decision in an auto-regressive manner based on aligned visual feature and navigation prompt.

## Results:
The proposed GPVL is compared with several state-of-the-art autonomous driving models on the nuScenes dataset. The experimental results are shown in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4. Then, qualitative experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GPVL, as illustrated in Fig. 2.
